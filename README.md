## General Information
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a dataset from the sale of houses in Australia.

> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

> The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
> From the analysis of the dataset, we find that the following are the most significant features determining the price of the houses:
